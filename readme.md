# **Project Overview**

This service implements a modern, scalable backend for managing inbound package intake sessions at last-mile Pickup Points, designed for logistics operations similar to Amazon Hub, UPS Access Points, or FedEx OnSite locations.

The system supports:

- registration of pickup points,
- execution of controlled intake sessions,
- real-time package registration,
- and operational insights into package flow and daily delivery activity.


It enforces strict domain correctness while remaining flexible, extensible, and fully observable—prepared for real production workloads.

# **Project Vision**

The goal of this project is to deliver a high-reliability, high-consistency system for handling inbound packages at decentralized Pickup Points across major U.S. metropolitan areas (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago).
